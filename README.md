#tunnel

Light up the tunnel by colliding with the spheres that come your way. The rotation of the squares gives the illusion of turning a corner. Spheres come in the rhythm of the drum track. As you light up the tunnel, the rest of the song fades in.. 


The drum track is loaded into an Stk object through ofSoundstream, and then analyzed for onset with Aubio.
